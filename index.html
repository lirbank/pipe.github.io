  <h1>Send from a different address or alias</h1>
  <p>
    This guide explains how to configure and authorize Gmail to send emails
    from another email address you own.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's use an example. Say you signed up for PIPE with a Gmail account where
    the primary email address is <code>john.doe@example.com</code>, but you but
    want your outbound emails to originate from <code>john@example.com</code>.
    If <code>john@example.com</code> isn't configured as an alias for your Gmail
    account, you'll have to add it, which we'll go through in the next steps.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that these instructions are actually more
    related to Gmail than to PIPE, but since PIPE relies on Gmail, and
    configuring Gmail to send using alias email addresses sometimes can be a
    bit confusing, we felt it would be good to put together a few steps to
    help with that.
  </p>

  <h2>Is my alias already configured?</h2>
  <p>
    In a web browser, sign in to your Gmail account (eg.
    <code>john.doe@example.com</code>) and click the <code>Compose</code>
    button to open a New Message dialog. Here you can click on the
    <code>From</code> field to see all email addresses the current Gmail
    account is authorized to send from.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> If you have multiple Google Accounts, double
    check that you're signed in with the Gmail account you signed up for PIPE
    with (eg. <code>john.doe@example.com</code>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's an example:

  <p>
    If you see the the email address you want to use as the sending address in
    the list, well, then youâ€™re good to go. If not, keep reading and you should
    be set up shortly.
  </p>

  <h2>Configure an alias email address</h2>
  <p>
    Follow these steps to add a new email address you own as a sending alias
    for your Gmail account.
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Substitute <code>john.doe@example.com</code> with the primary email of your
    Gmail account (the account you signed up for PIPE with) and
    <code>john@example.com</code> with the email address you want to add as an
    alias.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Navigate to <a href="http://mail.google.com/a/example.com" target="_blank">mail.google.com/a/example.com</a> and sign in with <code>john.doe@example.com</code></li>
    <li>Click <code>Settings</code> (cogwheel icon, top right corner) and then <code>Settings</code></li>
    <li>Select the <code>Accounts</code> tab</li>
    <li>Check that <code>john@example.com</code> is not already in the list</li>
    <li>Click <code>Add another email address you own</code></li>
    <li>In the dialog window, type <code>john@example.com</code> as the <code>Email address</code> and leave <code>Treat as an alias</code> checked. Click <code>Next Step</code></li>
    <li>On the second page, stay with the default SMTP settings <code>Send through example.com Mail (easier to set up)</code>, click <code>Next Step</code></li>
    <li>On the third page, click <code>Send Verification</code> and close the dialog window.</li>
    <li>Check your email for the verification email and click the approval link.</li>
  </ol>
